The server is currently in development, and will experience a lot of heavy changes during the next few months.
As that's said, don't expect a fully working server in the nearest future.
Anyone can help the project by forking, doing some work, and submitting a pull request.

Tools needed:
- .NET Framework 4.0 or newer / Mono Framework (experimental)
- MongoDB (when db support gets added)
- NUnit (for unit testing)
